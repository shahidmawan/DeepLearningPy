    "First we receive the input data array and then to send it to the first hidden layer. Then the data will begin to have a weight attached to it between layers (remember this is initially a random value) and then sent to a node to undergo an activation function (along with a Bias as mentioned in the lecture). Then it will continue on to the next hidden layer, and so on until the final output layer. In our case, we will just use two hidden layers, the more you use the longer the model will take to run (but it has more of an opportunity to possibly be more accurate on the training data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the transformed \"data\" has reached the output layer we need to evaluate it. Here we will use a loss function (also called a cost function) to evaluate how far off we are from the desired result. In this case, how many of the classes we got correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will apply an optimization function to minimize the cost (lower the error). This is done by adjusting weight values accordingly across the network. In out example, we will use the [Adam Optimizer](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980v8.pdf), which keep in mind, relative to other mathematical concepts, is an extremely recent development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can adjust how quickly to apply this optimization by changing our earlier learning rate parameter. The lower the rate the higher the possibility for accurate training results, but that comes at the cost of having to wait (physical time wise) for the results. Of course, after a certain point there is no benefit to lower the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will create our model, we'll start with 2 hidden layers, which use the [RELU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks) activation function, which is a very simple rectifier function which essentially either returns x or zero. For our final output layer we will use a linear activation with matrix multiplication:"
